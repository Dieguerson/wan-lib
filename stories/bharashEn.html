                            <em>Bharash</em>'s' first memory is the warmth of his clan’s incubating room. He was the only surviving hatchling of the Clethtinthiallor clan. As such he, and the woman who had been used by the clan to breed with their dragon overlord, were casted out, branded as cursed and left to die. As a consequence of their banishment and their pseudo-relationship as mother and son, Bharash and Sada stuck together.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text__paragraph--align">
                            Eventually, Sada found someone who loved her, understood her past and why she was always with a monster like Bharash. For a few years, the dragonborn enjoyed a normal childhood and made a few friends. However, Horwedja the rich merchant that married his mother, kicked him out and made everyone in town believe that Bharash was a dangerous monster. Because of this, Bharash, had to flee and start a wandering life, mostly hidden from society, getting his nourishment from nature.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text__paragraph--align">
                            Eventually he found a woman, Eloise, in seclusion from society as well, someone who didn’t reject him for his appearance and took him as a friend. As time passed and confidence grew, Bharash fell in love, and Eloise told him about her search for a fragment of “The Everything”, the great god of creation that broke apart after the world was formed.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text__paragraph--align">
                            In hopes of gaining her love in return, Bharash left her and started his pilgrimage in search for the fragment. During his travels he found two monks, Yang and Huizhong, a pair of acolytes from a Monastery that followed the monastic tradition of the Elements, who invited him to join them as a fellow trainee of the Elements. This seemed right to the dragonborn, by his nature he felt that this people could help him harness the power of electricity within him. After a few years of training, these monks let him know two things. First: his next step towards gaining control of the elements consisted in going back out to the world; Second: there was a monastery of the astral self that was said to have tethered a soul to a warforged whose core, supposedly, was a fragment of “The Everything”. The way of leaving the monastery was very different from the way of getting in. To leave, a portal would be opened, it would lead whoever crossed it nearer to his destiny. So, Bharash went through.
                        </p>

                            On the other side he found himself in front of a caravan master planning a trip to the village of Hommet. So, he booked a place in the caravan and began his journey.
